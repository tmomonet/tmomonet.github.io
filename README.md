 ## Introduction
    I love wild things wildly, I love quiet things quietly. I am a learner in the DeepDish and drinking Java bootstrap. My plan after graduation is to listen to the album Graduation and notice gradiations between that and his future projects, as well as Future's projects.
 ## Current projects
     * Hello World: Java console application
      
    * Hello World: Android app
